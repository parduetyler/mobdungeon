# Mob Dungeon
Mob Dungeon is a 2D Topdown Roguelite - A two-week project for a Game Design class. The game features procedurally-generated floor layouts, fit with enemies, items, and a boss. 

There are some aspects of the game, like the potions system, that are nonfunctional. Mob Dungeon features a limited randomized level, fit with over a dozen enemy rooms, a treasure room, and a final boss. This is the only level the game has at the moment. In the future, the game would have later levels that feature harder enemies and more rooms, along with many different types of enemies and bosses.
