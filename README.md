# Mob Dungeon
Mob Dungeon is a 2D Topdown Roguelite - It was a 2 week project for a Game Design class and is limited in scope. The game focuses on setting up different room layouts and offering randomized items for the player to get across the level.

There are some aspects of the game, like the potions system, that are nonfunctional. Mob Dungeon features a limited randomized level, fit with over a dozen enemy rooms, a treasure room, and a final boss. This is the only level the game has at the moment. In the future, the game would have later levels that feature harder enemies and more rooms, along with many different types of enemies and bosses.
